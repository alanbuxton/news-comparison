Erema's recycling systems play a key role in the process, converting a mixed stream of 95 % polypropylene (PP) rigids and 5 % polyethylene (PE) film into high-quality pellets. These pellets serve as the foundation for Moxietec's foam technology, which produces lightweight locking blocks for construction applications."

For decades, a drop in oil prices led to an immediate pullback in capital spending and production. Today, thanks to technological advancements and massive consolidation, the majors are able to pump more oil for less money. This has created a global surplus of 2–4 million barrels per day, prompting OPEC+ to announce a ""strategic pause"" in production hikes for the first quarter of 2026 to prevent a total price collapse.

Furthermore, Exxon’s focus on Low Carbon Solutions—including the successful progress of the Golden Pass LNG project and carbon capture initiatives—suggests the company is attempting to out-invest its critics rather than pivot away from its core business.

In a January 4 interview with the FT, Paul Griggs, U.S. Senior Partner and CEO of PwC, said the firm underwent a strategic reversal on digital assets last year as a result of the U.S. administration appointing pro-digital currency regulators and Congress passing new laws governing digital assets, namely stablecoins. "" The Genius Act and the regulatory rulemaking around stablecoin I expect will create more conviction around leaning into that product and that asset class ,"" Griggs told the FT. ""The tokenisation of things will certainly continue to evolve as well. PwC has to be in that ecosystem ."" According to the FT report, up until the beginning of Trump's second term, which started last January, the 'Big Four' firms-Deloitte, EY, KPMG, and PwC-had avoided auditing many digital asset-related businesses in the U.S., due to a combination of the tough stance taken by regulators, particularly the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) , and a lack of clear legislation governing the space."
