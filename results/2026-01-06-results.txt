NEW DELHI/SINGAPORE: Indian Oil Corp, the country's top refiner, has bought five cargoes of Russian oil for December arrival from non-sanctioned entities, traders said, resuming purchases despite pressure from Washington on India to stop buying Russian oil. Washington last week imposed sanctions on Rosneft and Lukoil, Russia's two largest oil companies, stepping up efforts to pressure President Vladimir Putin to end the war in Ukraine. Since then, many Indian refiners including state-run Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals Ltd, HPCL-Mittal Energy Ltd and Reliance Industries, operator of the world's biggest refining complex, have paused buying Russian oil. IOC's head of finance, Anuj Jain, however, has said his company will continue to buy Russian oil if the barrels are in compliance with sanctions. The European Union, the UK and the U.S. have imposed a raft of sanctions against Russia for the Ukraine war, including on shipping.

The refiner is expected to tap spot markets every month and seek additional supplies from its term suppliers as it has shunned oil from Russia to avoid sanction risks, a company source said. Indian refiner HPCL-Mittal Energy Ltd on Wednesday said it had also stopped buying Russian oil.

Viewpoint: New PE capacity favorable to buyers in 2026
Argus Media - 2026-01-02 00:00:00+00:00 
https://www.argusmedia.com/en/news-and-insights/latest-market-news/2769247-viewpoint-new-pe-capacity-favorable-to-buyers-in-2026
In 2026, approximately 2 million tons per year of new US polyethylene (PE) capacity is set to come online, primarily from the Golden Triangle Polymers joint venture between Chevron Phillips Chemical and QatarEnergy in Orange, Texas. This expansion is expected to favor domestic buyers, as increased supply may keep pricing power in their hands. However, producers are cautious about global oversupply, especially with additional PE capacity starting up in Asia. Regulatory and geopolitical factors, including anti-dumping duties imposed by Brazil on US and Canadian PE in 2025, are also affecting market dynamics. These developments could influence procurement strategies and supplier negotiations, particularly regarding pricing and risk management.

January 2026: Prices of Volume Resins Mostly Down Entering 2026
Plastics Technology Online - 2026-01-01 00:00:00+00:00 
https://www.ptonline.com/articles/january-2026-prices-of-volume-resins-mostly-down-entering-2026
Entering 2026, prices for polyethylene (PE) and polypropylene (PP) resins in the US are mostly flat to down, driven by supply/demand imbalances, lower feedstock costs, and plant maintenance. Demand for PE increased slightly in 2025, while PP demand was flat. Market conditions are pushing suppliers to export resin at lower prices, and demand is not driving the market. This suggests a buyer-friendly environment, but risks remain from potential feedstock cost increases, demand rebounds, and the impact of tariffs. Procurement strategies should consider these factors for negotiations and risk management.

COMMODITIES 2026: Global polyethylene packaging fundamentals to remain weak in H1
S&P Global - 2025-12-29 00:00:00+00:00 
https://www.spglobal.com/energy/en/news-research/latest-news/chemicals/122925-commodities-2026-global-polyethylene-packaging-fundamentals-to-remain-weak-in-h1
Supply pressures in the global PE market are expected to ease in the first half of 2026 due to rationalizations and limited plant startups, but margins may not recover. The China PE market is projected to be flat to up in H1 2026, potentially due to government incentives. These trends could impact US suppliers and buyers, influencing procurement strategies and risk management, especially regarding pricing and supply chain stability.

As of late 2025, North American resin markets remain buyer-friendly, with producers pushing for small price increases for PE and PP, but demand remains weak. Spot availability is strong, and the market is near the bottom of the cycle. Key risks for Q1 2026 include propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reliability and winter weather impacts. These factors could affect supplier risk and procurement negotiations, making it important for buyers to monitor market conditions closely.

Producers are cautious about global oversupply but expect capacity rationalization in other regions to create export opportunities. Geopolitical events and trade tariffs have caused market volatility, limiting demand growth. Low ethane/ethylene prices contribute to lower PE prices, expected to balance as US olefins exports rise in 2026.

Demand-side measures seen as an important lever to scale Europe's zero-emission truck market, new study finds
ACEA - 2025-12-22 00:00:00+00:00 
https://www.acea.auto/news/demand-side-measures-seen-as-an-important-lever-to-scale-europes-zero-emission-truck-market-new-study-finds/
A new report by the Smart Freight Centre (SFC) highlights that while zero-emission trucks (ZETs) are available in Europe, their market uptake is lagging. The report suggests that smart and coordinated demand-side measures should be considered to align with regulatory ambition. The main challenge is not technology readiness but the pace at which demand can scale to match regulatory ambition. Demand is currently not keeping pace with supply-side requirements, as persistent TCO gaps, high upfront and operating costs, infrastructure and grid delays, and uneven implementation of EU legislation continue to slow ZET uptake.
