Below is a **business-user-focused comparison** of the five providers based on the file you supplied (1,585 total results). I sampled multiple stories per provider across industries and then **verified actual articles, dates, relevance, and accessibility** using the live web.

I’ve referenced specific articles as evidence for each point.

# Key thematic observations across providers

Looking at the validated stories:

### Packaging (India)

* Capex and automation investments.
* Premium packaging demand driving capacity expansion. ([PrintWeekIndia][1])

### Resins (US/Europe)

* Weak demand, oversupply, falling or flat prices. ([LinkedIn][2])
* Supply-demand imbalances shaping 2026 outlook. ([LinkedIn][2])

These are exactly the kinds of **high-level market signals** you described.

---

# Final recommendation

For your meeting-prep use case:

## Use **Syracuse** as the primary provider

Because it:

* Returns mostly real business news.
* Focuses on strategic events.
* Has fewer false positives.
* Produces a skimmable set of stories.

## Use **Exa** as a secondary feed

If:

* You want broader coverage.
* You can filter out:

  * Market-research pages
  * Error rows.

---

If you’d like, I can:

* Produce a **clean, deduplicated briefing** for each industry/location.
* Rank the top 5–10 stories per segment.
* Create a one-page “meeting-ready” digest.
