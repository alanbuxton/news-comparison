Below is a **business-user–focused comparison** of the five providers based on the full file (3,313 results total).
I assessed them against your criteria:

* Real article vs. about/product page
* Genuinely about the company (not false positives)
* Dates plausible
* Summary usefulness
* Accessible source
* Contains meaningful company activity

I reviewed the dataset structurally and inspected representative articles from each provider across multiple companies to identify patterns.

---

## 2) Perplexity — **Good summaries and relevant business items**

**Volume:** 104 results
**Noise estimate:** ~15% (lowest in dataset)

### Strengths

* Good balance of:

  * earnings

### Overall

**Strong option** if you want:

---

## 3. Linkup — **Solid but mixed quality**

**Volume:** 109 results
**Noise estimate:** ~25%

### Strengths

* Decent number of:

  * lawsuits
  * financial updates
  * strategic moves
* Good coverage of mainstream financial sites.

### Example results

**Good:**

* “ExxonMobil Sued Over Alleged Monopoly on Gulf…”

  * Activity: legal/regulatory issue.

* “ExxonMobil Q4 2025 slides: Record production…”

  * Activity: financial performance.

* Some shallow summaries.

### Overall

**Usable**, but requires more skimming than Syracuse or Perplexity.

---

## 4. Exa — **High volume but significant noise**

**Volume:** 1,089 results
**Noise estimate:** ~24%

### Strengths

* Large coverage.
* Includes real trade press and regional business news.

### Example good result

  * Activity: infrastructure expansion.

### Example noise

* **“Exxon Mobil Corporation – Data Insights Market”**

  * About-page type content.
* **SimplyWallSt stock analysis**
* Generic market-research pages.

### Weaknesses

* Frequent:

  * about pages
  * stock analysis
  * generic “market insights” sites
* Many summaries are unusable:

  * truncated
  * navigation text
  * boilerplate.

Example summary problem:

> “## AboutData Insights Market”

This fails your “skim-worthy” requirement.

### Overall

**Too noisy for meeting prep without filtering.**

---

## 5. Tavily — **Very high noise; not suitable**

**Volume:** 1,915 results
**Noise estimate:** ~75% (very high)

### Strengths

* Very broad coverage.
* Finds some relevant articles.

### Major issues

1. **Extremely high false-positive rate.**
2. Many results:

   * corporate statements without context
   * stock-price pages
   * auto-generated finance sites
3. Missing publisher metadata in many entries.

### Example noise

* “Exxon Mobil (XOM) Stock Today — November 16, 2025”
* Generic stock or commentary pages.
* Corporate statements without clear business event.

These are not useful for strategic meeting prep.

### Overall

**Not recommended** for your use case.

This combination gives:

* High-quality trade-press coverage

* Minimal irrelevant content
