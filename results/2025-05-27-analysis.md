|Distribution Services (Distribution, Mastering, Localization etc), Northern America|0|20|3|

Look at some where there is a big difference:

### PE Resins, US
- Perplexity: Good selection of specific news but only generic industry stuff, nothing about the particular companies
- Syracuse: Includes info from companies in the industry. Also includes wider plastics news, which is arguably false positives here.
- Linkup: Similar to Perplexity

Perplexity/Linkup better at general industry news. Syracuse better at specific company news, but is broader than just this industry sector.

### Film (BOPP Film, BOPET, PE Film etc), CN
This is a type of plastic used for wrapping things. Not the sorts of films that Bollywood makes.

- Perplexity: 3 articles are not news articles. 
- Syracuse: False positives - articles are online film businesses, not this type of Film
- Linkup: Got nothing

None of these three are any good.

### Distribution Services (Distribution, Mastering, Localization etc), Northern America
This is distribution related to Films, not about physical logistics

- Perplexity: Got none.
- Syracuse: Physical distribution
- Linkup: Physical distribution

None are any good.
