Based on the comparison results provided, **Syracuse** appears to be the most effective news provider for high-volume, specifically targeted corporate and industry activity, while **Perplexity** is the best for high-level summaries and comprehensive background information. **LinkUp** generally provided the fewest results across the categories.

The following evaluation is based on your specific criteria for correct dates and topical relevance:

### **1. Performance Overview**

* **Syracuse**: Consistently delivered a high number of relevant results, particularly for specific corporate actions like role changes, operations, and partnerships.


*  **Perplexity**: Often provided more results than LinkUp and included deep dives into corporate strategy and long-term outlooks.


*  **LinkUp**: Provided the lowest volume of results in most categories, though its results were generally accurate and relevant to the companies mentioned.


### **2. Published Date Accuracy**

All three providers generally used correct and current dates (ranging from late 2025 to early 2026), but there were notable differences in how they handled them:

*  **Syracuse** provided highly granular timestamps (e.g., "2025-12-26 09:16:30"), which is useful for tracking the exact timing of news breaks.


*  **Perplexity** tended to use "00:00:00" for its timestamps, suggesting it may pull from sources where specific times are not as clearly defined or prioritized.



### **3. Topical Relevance**

* **Highly Relevant (ExxonMobil & Borouge)**: Both **Syracuse** and **Perplexity** performed well in ensuring the story was primarily about the company. For example, both accurately captured ExxonMobil's 2030 Plan updates and Borouge's launch of the "Recleo" brand.


* **Contextual Relevance Issues**: **Syracuse** and **LinkUp** occasionally struggled with industry-specific searches. For the "Flexible Packaging" category in China, **Syracuse** returned 0 results, whereas **LinkUp** returned stories that were about the *film industry* (movies) rather than *packaging films*. In contrast, **Perplexity** correctly identified suppliers of BOPP and BOPET packaging films.



### **Summary of Results by Category**

| Company/Region | Perplexity Results | Syracuse Results | LinkUp Results |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **ExxonMobil** | 10 | 13 | 6 |
| **Borouge** | 8 | 2 | 0  |
| **HPCL Mittal Energy** | 5  | 5  | 1  |
| **Sigma Chemtrade** | 0  | 0  | 0  |

**Conclusion:** For a balance of high-volume results and specific corporate activity (like management changes or local operations), **Syracuse** is the strongest. However, for specialized industry topics where keywords might be ambiguous (like "packaging films"), **Perplexity** demonstrated better topical accuracy.
