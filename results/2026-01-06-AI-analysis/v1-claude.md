I'll analyze the three news providers (Perplexity, Syracuse, and LinkUp) across the different companies and industries to determine which performs best.

## Analysis by Category

### Companies

**ExxonMobil:**
- **Perplexity (10 stories):** Good coverage of major announcements, but some articles are dated December 2025 (future dates relative to the knowledge cutoff)
- **Syracuse (13 stories):** Best coverage with recent, relevant stories including charitable donations, operational updates, and partnerships
- **LinkUp (6 stories):** Adequate but least comprehensive

**Borouge:**
- **Perplexity (8 stories):** Good industry coverage
- **Syracuse (2 stories):** Limited but relevant product launches
- **LinkUp (0 stories):** No coverage

**HPCL Mittal Energy:**
- **Perplexity (5 stories):** Good coverage of major investment announcements
- **Syracuse (5 stories):** Strong coverage including operational changes
- **LinkUp (1 story):** Minimal coverage

**Westrock/International Paper:**
- All three providers show reasonable coverage with focus on M&A and restructuring

**Klöckner Pentaplast:**
- **Syracuse (6 stories):** Best coverage of the Chapter 11 restructuring
- **Perplexity (6-7 stories):** Good coverage
- **LinkUp (2-9 stories):** Variable coverage

### Industries/Regions

**PE Resins - US:**
- **Perplexity (4 stories):** Good market analysis
- **Syracuse (0 stories):** No coverage
- **LinkUp (2 stories):** Limited coverage

**Road Freight - Europe:**
- **Perplexity (17 stories):** Excellent comprehensive coverage
- **Syracuse (13 stories):** Good coverage
- **LinkUp (2 stories):** Limited

**Film Distribution:**
- **Syracuse (20 stories):** Extensive coverage of M&A and industry developments
- **LinkUp (10 stories):** Good coverage
- **Perplexity (1-3 stories):** Limited

## Date Accuracy Issues

**Critical problem:** Perplexity shows multiple articles with dates in **December 2025 and January 2026** (future dates), which is impossible given the current date is January 14, 2026, and the knowledge cutoff is January 2025. This suggests either:
1. Date parsing errors
2. Articles incorrectly dated
3. System errors in date attribution

Examples from Perplexity:
- "Aviation Week Network's MRO Latin America will be held in Santiago, Chile, January 14-15" (2026-01-06)
- Multiple "2026-01-06" dated articles

## Verdict

**Winner: Syracuse Company News API**

**Reasons:**
1. **Most consistent date accuracy** - Stories are properly dated and current
2. **Best company-specific coverage** - Stories are clearly about the companies mentioned
3. **Good breadth** - Covers multiple activity types (CorporateFinanceActivity, PartnershipActivity, RoleActivity, etc.)
4. **Relevant content** - High signal-to-noise ratio with procurement-relevant information

**Runner-up: LinkUp**
- Strong for specific niches (MRO, packaging in India)
- Good date consistency
- More focused but sometimes limited coverage

**Perplexity issues:**
- **Date problems are disqualifying** - Multiple future-dated or incorrectly dated articles
- Good breadth but reliability concerns
- Some articles appear to be summaries rather than original news sources

For procurement and supplier intelligence purposes, **Syracuse** provides the most reliable, timely, and actionable company-specific news.
