## AI Analysis

Prompt used (Companies):

```
The attached file contains search results from different news providers: Exa, Linkup, Perplexity, Syracuse and Tavily. It covers searches for news about specific companies. The search results are for news over 3 months to Feb 10th, 2026 and cover the following company names: ExxonMobil, Borouge, Sigma Chemtrade, HPCL Mittal Energy, L M Goes Embalagens, Westrock, International Paper, Dine Cartonnages, Jiangin Yonghe Packaging Products, Fritz Foss, Husky Technologies, KRC Custom Manufacturing, Braroll Acessorios Industriais, Jindal Films, Klöckner Pentaplast, Klockner Pentaplast, Entertainment Partners, Universal McCann, Little Island Productions, Commerzbank AG, Linklaters, CBS News, Deloitte, Bloomberg.

I need you to compare the results and summarise the pros and cons of each of these providers. Ensure you check all the articles from each provider.

The context is: I am a business user who is preparing for a meeting in a few days about our relationship with a particular company. This could be a meeting with a sales prospect, a meeting with a supplier or a meeting with a current customer. Or it could be for internal strategic planning.

To help me in these I need to know some high-level context about notable events for this company. I don't want lots of noise on day to day activities, but I do want stories that will give me a fuller picture of what the company is up to. This could include product launches, strategic moves, M&A activity, financial performance, investment news, regulatory issues or market positioning updates, expansion activities or key personnel changes.

Examples of desirable content:
- Product launches 
- Strategic moves
- M&A activity
- Financial performance
- Investment news
- Regulatory issues
- Market positioning updates
- Expansion activities
- Key personnel changes

Examples of undesirable content:
- A company's about us page
- Content from the company's product catalog
- Content aimed at general public about how to use a company's products
- Wider industry analysis that touches on this company

I don't want to have to click into dozens of articles to get the full picture. I want some results that I can skim to get a good idea about what the underlying story is. But I do need to know that I can click through to the source article for more detail if I want to.

Which provider should I use for this?

When assessing each story check that:
- It is are real article (as opposed to about us or product listings)
- It is genuinely about the company (false positives are a big problem)
- The date given in the results file match the real published date of the article (within a day or so to allow for timezone differences)
- The summary gives sufficient information on the story
- The underlying source web page can be accessed without any additional paywall
- It includes an activity to do with the company, rather than just general industry background

When providing your analysis give your reasoning and refer to specific articles to support your assessment.
