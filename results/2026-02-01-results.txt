ExxonMobil has officially broken ground on its highly anticipated Baytown Refinery Reconfiguration Project, marking a pivotal shift in its downstream strategy. The expansion at the massive Texas complex is designed to significantly ramp up production of high-value Group III lubricant base stocks and ultra-low sulfur diesel (ULSD) , moving the energy giant away from traditional gasoline-heavy production.

By adding approximately 8,000 barrels per day (BPD) of Group III base stock capacity, ExxonMobil is addressing a long-standing supply deficit in North America, which has historically relied on imports from the Middle East and Asia for these essential synthetic-grade oils.

PwC to increase engagement with digital asset firms

https://coingeek.com/pwc-to-increase-engagement-with-digital-asset-firms/
Big four accountancy firm PriceWaterhouseCooper (PwC) has decided to ditch the more cautious stance it has maintained towards digital assets up to now and "lean in" to the sector, following legislative progress and a shift away from hardline regulation since last January's inauguration of United States President Donald Trump, according to a report by the Financial Times. In a January 4 interview with the FT, Paul Griggs, U.S. Senior Partner and CEO of PwC, said the firm underwent a strategic reversal on digital assets last year as a result of the U.S. administration appointing pro-digital currency regulators and Congress passing new laws governing digital assets, namely stablecoins. " The Genius Act and the regulatory rulemaking around stablecoin I expect will create more conviction around leaning into that product and that asset class ," Griggs told the FT. "The tokenisation of things will certainly continue to evolve as well. PwC has to be in that ecosystem ." According to the FT report, up until the beginning of Trump's second term, which started last January, the 'Big Four' firms-Deloitte, EY, KPMG, and PwC-had avoided auditing many digital asset-related businesses in the U.S., due to a combination of the tough stance taken by regulators, particularly the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) , and a lack of clear legislation governing the space.

London, 15 January (Argus) - Danish shipping firm Maersk will switch one of its routes back to using the Suez Canal full-time, after successful transits of two ships from its fleet at the end of 2025. The company will move its MECL route, which runs between the Middle East/India and the US Atlantic coast, back to using Suez rather than around the Cape of Good Hope, bringing it back to its route prior to Yemen - based Houthi militants beginning a campaign of attacks against shipping in late 2023. In November, the Houthis signalled a pause to their attacks following the ceasefire agreement between Israel and the Palestinian militant group Hamas a month earlier. The first Maersk vessel to journey through the canal will depart an origin east of Suez on 15 January, and another will leave the US on 10 January. Maersk said it is monitoring the situation in the Bab el-Mandeb strait at the mouth of the Red Sea, where Houthi attacks have been concentrated, and said it will switch back to using the Cape of Good Hope route if it feels there is a risk to its vessels.
