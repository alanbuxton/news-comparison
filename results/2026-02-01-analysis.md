## AI Analysis

Prompt used:

```
The attached file contains search results from 3 news providers: Linkup, Perplexity and Syracuse. It covers searches for news about specific companies and searches for news about specific industry sectors in particular locations. The search results are for news over 3 months to Feb 1st, 2026.

I need you to compare the results and summarise the pros and cons of each of these providers.

The context is: I am a busy professional and am preparing for a meeting about our relationship with a particular company or within an industry/location. This could be: preparing for a meeting with a sales prospect or a meeting with a supplier. To help me in these I need to know some context about notable events for that company or for the industry/location that I am targeting. Or it could be for internal strategic planning.

Which provider should I use for this?

I don't want noise on normal company activities, but I do want to know context that will give me a fuller picture of important events that impact that company or industry/location.

When checking the providers please check that the articles are real articles, that the dates are the correct published dates and that there is some notable relevance to the company or industry/region in question.
