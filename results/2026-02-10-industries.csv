The deal for Warner Bros. “spurs a new wave of portfolio rationalization and puts pressure on other players to streamline operations, shed non-core assets, and secure partnerships for content, distribution, and technology,” it argued. PwC’s recommendation: “Companies should begin identifying opportunities for bundling and cross-platform partnerships that can strengthen margins and improve subscriber retention. At the same time, they should consider divesting underperforming linear or regional assets to unlock capital for investments in premium IP or complementary platform extensions, such as video games.” [...] Outside of Hollywood, PwC also highlighted other hot sectors. “Gaming is solidifying its place as a core pillar of the entertainment ecosystem,” it argued, pointing to the $55 billion take-private of Electronic Arts by PIF, Silver Lake, and Affinity Partners. “Beyond this landmark transaction, deal activ"

The streaming and entertainment network was locked in a fierce bidding war with Paramount Skydance and Comcast for the iconic studio. Netflix offered the largest bid and reportedly included a $5 billion breakup fee if regulators don't clear the deal. (The proposed deal would split off Warner Bros.
