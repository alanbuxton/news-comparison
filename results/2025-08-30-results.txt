ExxonMobil's second-quarter profit dropped to the lowest level in four years as OPEC+ ramped up production and oil prices slumped. The Texas oil driller still topped Wall Street profit expectations Friday and shares rose slightly before the opening bell, even with global markets falling on the erratic trade policies of the U.S. The price for a barrel of U.S. benchmark crude has remained below $ 70 for most of the year and in May dropped below $ 60. ExxonMobil earned $ 7.08 billion, or $ 1.64 per share, for the period ended June 30. A year earlier it earned $ 9.24 billion, or $ 2.14 per share.

ExxonMobil announced robust second-quarter 2025 results, reporting earnings of $ 7.1 billion, or $ 1.64 per diluted share. Revenue came in at $ 81.51 billion, reflecting a 12 % decline from the previous year, a drop attributed largely to lower oil and natural gas prices during the period. Despite these challenges, the company's cash flow from operations reached an impressive $ 11.5 billion. Shareholder returns remained strong, with $ 9.2 billion distributed through a combination of $ 4.3 billion in dividends and $ 5 billion in share repurchases, underscoring ExxonMobil's commitment to capital discipline and shareholder value. CEO Darren Woods highlighted that the quarter marked ExxonMobil's highest second-quarter upstream production volume since the Exxon and Mobil merger over 25 years ago.

ExxonMobil beats profit estimates as higher output counters weaker oil prices
BIC Magazine - 2025-08-01 08:37:41.830095+00:00  - FinancialsActivity
https://www.bicmagazine.com/departments/operations/exxonmobil-beats-profit-estimates/
(Reuters) ExxonMobil, the United States' biggest oil producer, beat Wall Street estimates for second-quarter profit as higher oil and gas output and low production costs offset the impact of lower crude prices. Oil and gas production was the highest for any second quarter since the merger of Exxon and Mobil formed the company more than 25 years ago, ExxonMobil said. Adjusted earnings during the second quarter were $ 7.1 billion, or $ 1.64 per share, surpassing consensus analyst estimates of $ 1.56 per share, data compiled by LSEG showed. The energy sector has struggled with price volatility as the OPEC+ group increased its production, pushing global benchmark Brent crude prices down 11 % in the quarter. Global tariffs levied by U.S. President Donald Trump added to price weakness because they raised the prospect of a weakening global economy with knock-on effects for oil demand.

New Delhi: India's ambitious plan to set up small nuclear reactors-called Bharat small reactors or BSRs-for captive industrial use is off to a promising start, with major companies lining up to participate, according to two people aware of the development. Companies including Reliance Industries, Adani Group, Indian Railways, Greenko, Vedanta, HPCL-Mittal Energy Ltd (HMEL) , JSW Group, and Hindalco Industries have responded to a request for proposal (RFP) floated by state-run Nuclear Power Corporation of India Ltd (NPCIL) for setting up two units of 220-Mwe pressurized heavy water reactor (PHWR) BSRs, the people cited above said on condition of anonymity. PWHR is a type of nuclear reactor that uses heavy water both as a coolant and a moderator. The strategic move is aimed at helping the country achieve a net-zero carbon emission goal by 2070. While India currently has an installed nuclear power generation capacity of 8.78 giga watt (GW) , the target is to develop 22.48 GW by 2030 and 100GW by 2047.

Sweden-headquartered fintech Enigio has teamed up with Commerzbank and Siemens to complete a proof-of-concept for a digital trade transaction between Germany and China. The project entailed transmitting original electronic versions of trade documents, including an electronic bill of lading (eBL) , to support the export of goods from Siemens in Germany to an importer in China. The test transaction also involved an export letter of credit issued by an unnamed Chinese bank, with Commerzbank acting as advising bank. The eBL was issued by Hamburg - based freight forwarder Fr Meyer's Sohn using Enigio's trace: original and digital envelope technology. Enigio says the collaboration reduced the time taken to process documents from around two weeks to less than two hours, and demonstrates "the power of fully digital trade document flows between Germany and China".

CBH grain co-op pilots biofuels project to cut shipping emissions

https://www.thenews.coop/cbh-grain-co-op-pilots-biofuels-project-to-cut-shipping-emissions/
The farmer - owned exporter, based in Western Australia, is working with shipping firms Norden and Oldendorff to meet new EU regulations. Australia's largest co-op and exporter of grain says it is cutting its maritime supply chain emissions as part of a biofuels insetting pilot project in partnership with two global shipping giants. CBH Group is working with Norden and Oldendorff, shipping companies which use waste - based biofuels, using book and claim solutions to transport Western Australian grain to the EU. The biofuel-powered voyages, which follow trials with Oldendorff on shipments to Vietnam in 2022, achieved significant emission reductions compared to traditional fossil fuels, said CBH, at no additional cost to its growers, providing a practical response to new EU regulations impacting all ships over 5,000 gross tonnages calling at European ports. Part of the EU's Fit for 55 climate legislation package, the regulations comprise a series of targets aimed at reducing CO2 emissions generated by marine transport.
