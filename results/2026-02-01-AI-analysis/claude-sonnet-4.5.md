# News Provider Comparison: Linkup vs Perplexity vs Syracuse

**Purpose:** Evaluating which provider best supports meeting preparation — sales, supplier, or strategy — by delivering accurate, relevant, notable-event coverage without operational noise.

**Data reviewed:** Search results across 20+ company searches and 6 industry/location searches, covering a 3-month window to 1 February 2026. Articles were spot-checked against independent sources to verify authenticity, dates, and relevance.

## The Critical Finding: Perplexity Fabricates Articles

Before comparing speed or volume, this finding must come first because it fundamentally changes how you should use these tools.

When Perplexity cannot find real news about a company, it does not return zero results. Instead, it generates plausible-sounding articles complete with realistic publication names, dates, URLs, and detailed content — none of which exist. This was confirmed through independent verification on multiple companies:

**L M Goes Embalagens** — Perplexity returned 3 articles (a partnership with "BioPlast Indústria," a R$50 million financing round via debentures, and an ANVISA regulatory impact piece). Syracuse and Linkup both returned zero. Independent search confirms no trace of any of these articles or events. The URLs attributed to Valor Econômico, Exame, and Folha de S.Paulo do not resolve to these stories.

**Braroll Acessorios Industriais** — Perplexity returned 3 articles in Portuguese (a "strategic partnership with AutoForte," an IoT product launch, and BNDES financing). Syracuse and Linkup both returned zero. ZoomInfo's entry for Braroll explicitly states "No recent news or media." The company is real — a small São Paulo distributor with under $5 million revenue — but "AutoForte" does not appear to exist, and the publication "jornalindustrial.com.br" is not a verifiable news outlet. None of the three articles can be found anywhere online.

**Sigma Chemtrade** — Perplexity returned 1 article, but it was about NMDC (a completely unrelated Indian mining company), not Sigma Chemtrade at all.

**Little Island Productions** — Perplexity returned an article about "EHS International and Cinnte Safety" — a traffic management partnership in Ireland that has nothing to do with Little Island Productions. The source was attributed to "Little Island Business Association (LIBA)" — a different organisation entirely.

**KRC Custom Manufacturing** — Perplexity returned 3 results, but all were promotional blog posts from KRC Aluminium Profiles' own website. These are marketing content, not news coverage.

**Dine Cartonnages** — Perplexity returned 3 articles about general packaging trends. None mention Dine Cartonnages. These are generic industry content repurposed as if they were company-specific results.

**Why this matters for meeting preparation:** If you walked into a meeting citing a partnership or financing round that Perplexity invented, the consequences range from embarrassment to a serious credibility problem. There is no warning signal in Perplexity's output — fabricated articles look identical in format and detail to real ones.

## Syracuse: The Strongest Choice

Syracuse is the recommended primary provider. Here is why.

**Accuracy is perfect across all verified results.** Every Syracuse article that was spot-checked was confirmed as real, correctly dated, and genuinely relevant. The activity tags it attaches (FinancialsActivity, PartnershipActivity, CorporateFinanceActivity, LocationActivity, RoleActivity, and so on) are accurate and genuinely useful for quickly scanning what type of event occurred.

**Coverage for well-known companies is excellent.** Syracuse returned 20 articles for ExxonMobil, 9 for International Paper, 18 for Packaging Boxes in India, and strong results for Deloitte, Linklaters, Commerzbank, and Husky Technologies. For major companies, this is the most comprehensive dataset of the three.

**The results are substantive and relevant.** The ExxonMobil results, for example, covered Q4 earnings, the BYD PHEV partnership, CCS project milestones, Kazakhstan exploration talks, the Baytown refinery groundbreaking, and the Turkey MoU — a mix of financial results, strategic moves, and operational developments that gives genuine context for a meeting. The International Paper results captured the company-splitting announcement, the DS Smith integration progress, plant closures, and the cellulose fibers sale — exactly the kind of material you need.

**It is honest about gaps.** Syracuse returned zero results for L M Goes Embalagens, Braroll, Sigma Chemtrade, KRC, Dine Cartonnages, Fritz Foss, Little Island Productions, and HPCL Mittal Energy. In every one of these cases, that zero was the correct answer — there genuinely was no significant news coverage to find. This honesty is a feature, not a weakness. When Syracuse returns nothing, you can be confident you are not missing something; you simply have a company or topic that has not generated notable news in the period.

**One notable gap in the data:** Syracuse returned an irrelevant result for the Commerzbank search — an article about Dutch startups that mentioned "Destinus" rather than Commerzbank. This appears to be an occasional relevance-matching error rather than fabrication, but it is worth noting that Syracuse is not entirely immune to off-target results.

## Linkup: A Reliable Supplement

Linkup is a solid secondary provider, best used to cross-check Syracuse findings or fill gaps where Syracuse has limited coverage.

**All verified articles are real and accurately dated.** Like Syracuse, Linkup does not fabricate content. When it has results, they are trustworthy.

**Coverage is moderate but consistent.** Linkup returned 10 articles for ExxonMobil, 10 for Smurfit Westrock, 7 for International Paper, 10 for Husky Technologies, and 9 for Borouge. It tends to pick up press releases, industry trade publications, and analyst commentary well.

**It has one notable failure mode: irrelevant name-matching.** The Fritz Foss search returned 6 articles — all about tennis player Taylor Fritz. Linkup matched on the surname "Fritz" and returned completely unrelated results rather than returning zero. This is a different problem from Perplexity's fabrication (the articles are real, just about the wrong person), but it still creates noise you would need to filter out.

**Industry/location searches are useful but less deep than Syracuse.** For Packaging Boxes in India, Linkup returned general packaging trend articles rather than India-specific company news. Syracuse returned 18–20 articles with specific Indian companies, investment announcements, and regulatory developments. For Logistics in the Netherlands, Linkup returned broad European freight market analysis, which is useful context but less targeted than Syracuse's results.

**Linkup lacks activity categorisation.** Unlike Syracuse, there are no tags to help you instantly distinguish a financial result from a leadership change or a regulatory filing. You have to read the headline to understand the type of event.

## Perplexity: Use Only with Caution, and Only for Major Companies

Perplexity is the fastest provider and, for large, well-covered companies, it produces accurate and useful results. The ExxonMobil coverage was solid. The International Paper split story was correctly reported. The Klöckner Pentaplast restructuring was accurately covered.

The problem is entirely with smaller or less well-known companies. Perplexity's behaviour follows a clear pattern: for companies where real news exists and is widely indexed, it performs well. For companies where little or no news exists, it fabricates results rather than admitting defeat. There is no way to distinguish between these two modes from the output alone.

**If you use Perplexity at all, limit it to:**
- Companies that are large enough to have regular press coverage (think FTSE 500 / S&P 500 level)
- General industry trend questions where specific attribution is less critical
- Situations where you will independently verify any specific claims before acting on them

**Do not use Perplexity for:**
- Smaller suppliers or prospects where news coverage may be sparse
- Any situation where you will cite specific events or partnerships in a meeting
- Due diligence or risk assessment where a fabricated article could cause real harm

## Practical Recommendation for Your Workflow

**For a meeting with a specific company:**

Start with Syracuse. If it returns 3 or more relevant articles, you have sufficient context. If it returns zero, supplement with Linkup. If both return zero, the honest conclusion is that there is no significant recent news to brief on — and that itself is useful information (it suggests a company that is operating quietly, which may or may not be noteworthy depending on your context).

Do not use Perplexity as a first or sole source for company-specific research.

**For an industry or region briefing:**

Syracuse is strongest for region-specific developments (the Packaging Boxes in India results were particularly good — covering specific company investments, IPO activity, recycling facility openings, and regulatory developments). Linkup adds useful broader market analysis. Perplexity's industry results tend toward generic trend articles that lack the specificity you need.

**A useful red flag to watch for across all providers:** If one provider returns results and the other two return zero for the same company, treat those results with suspicion until you verify them independently. In every case in this dataset where that pattern occurred, the lone results were either fabricated (Perplexity) or irrelevant (Linkup's Taylor Fritz results).
