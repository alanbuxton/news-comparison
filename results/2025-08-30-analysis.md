|PE Resins, US|5|20|0||

|Distribution Services (Distribution, Mastering, Localization etc), Northern America|4|18|0||

Look at some where there is a big difference:

### PE Resins, US
- Perplexity: Good selection of specific news but only generic industry stuff, nothing about the particular companies
- Syracuse: Includes info from companies in the industry. Also includes wider plastics news, which is arguably false positives here.
- Linkup: Nothing

Perplexity better at general industry news. Syracuse better at specific company news, but is broader than just this industry sector.

### Film (BOPP Film, BOPET, PE Film etc), CN
This is a type of plastic used for wrapping things. Not the sorts of films that Bollywood makes.

- Perplexity: Articles are not news articles. 
- Syracuse: False positives - has some good articles but also lots of false positives about the film (entertainment) industry)
- Linkup: Got nothing

Linkup is strongest here

### Distribution Services (Distribution, Mastering, Localization etc), Northern America
This is distribution related to Films, not about physical logistics

- Perplexity: Physical distribution
- Syracuse: Physical distribution
- Linkup: Got nothing

None are any good.
